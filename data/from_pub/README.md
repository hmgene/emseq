'Beaudin' PMID 27666010 - DEGs comparing FL versus adult HSCs - positive FC values are enriched in FL, negative values in BM.
'Tan' PMID 31851943 - DEGs comparing adult versus FL HSCs - positive FC values are enriched in ADULT, negative in FL (the other way around).

The ATAC-seq datasets are from PMID 35584393 - these are pseudobulk of the scATAC-seq from this paper.  They are MACS readout files - one with peaks enriched in FL vs adult HSCs, the other adult vs FL HSCs.  As a sanity check, there are more accessible regions in FL compared to adult HSCs as we would expect.
